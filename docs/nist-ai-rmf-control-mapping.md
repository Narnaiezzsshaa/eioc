# EIOC–NIST AI RMF Control Mapping v1.0

**Conceptual Standard for Human-Layer Risk Management**

**Author:** Narnaiezzsshaa Truong

**Status:** Open Standard (Conceptual Mapping)

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the conceptual control mapping between the Emotional Indicators of Compromise (EIOC) framework and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) 1.0.

It identifies how EIOC provides the operational, measurable, and auditable controls required to satisfy human-layer risk management expectations across the AI RMF's four core functions:

- **Govern**
- **Map**
- **Measure**
- **Manage**

This mapping is format-agnostic and may be implemented in any technical or organizational environment.

---

## 2. Mapping Philosophy

EIOC provides:

- Detection primitives
- Tiered escalation logic
- Operator posture protocols
- Verification rituals
- Documentation artifacts

These correspond directly to NIST's requirements for:

- Human agency
- Oversight
- Contextual risk identification
- Trustworthiness assessment
- Incident response
- Continuous monitoring

**EIOC is the operational layer that makes NIST's human-layer requirements implementable.**

## 3. Control Mapping Table (Conceptual)

Below is the conceptual mapping between EIOC primitives and NIST AI RMF subcategories.

This is not a schema. This is not a file format. This is the conceptual relationship auditors and compliance officers rely on.

---

### 3.1 GOVERN Function

#### GOVERN 1.1 – Organizational Culture & Risk Posture

**NIST Requirement:**  
Organizations must establish a culture that recognizes and manages AI-related risks.

**EIOC Contribution:**
- Operator Posture (Stewardship Model)
- Circuit Breaker Cues
- Boundary Integrity Principles

**How EIOC Satisfies This:**  
EIOC reframes emotional drift and boundary distortion as security events, not personal failures, establishing a culture where emotional-layer risks are recognized and acted upon.

---

#### GOVERN 1.2 – Human Roles & Responsibilities

**NIST Requirement:**  
Roles for human oversight must be clearly defined.

**EIOC Contribution:**
- Operator → Steward role definition
- Tier Escalation Structure
- Second-Operator Protocols

**How EIOC Satisfies This:**  
EIOC defines the operator as a steward of system integrity, with explicit responsibilities tied to drift detection, verification, and escalation.

---

### 3.2 MAP Function

#### MAP 1.1 – Contextual Risk Identification

**NIST Requirement:**  
Organizations must identify how AI systems may cause harm in context.

**EIOC Contribution:**
- Emotional Drift
- Boundary Distortion
- Identity Disruption
- Affinity Pretexting

**How EIOC Satisfies This:**  
EIOC identifies emotional-layer manipulation vectors that emerge during AI-mediated interactions, enabling contextual risk mapping.

---

#### MAP 2.2 – Human-AI Interaction Risks

**NIST Requirement:**  
Organizations must identify risks arising from human-AI interactions.

**EIOC Contribution:**
- Red-Flag Pattern Library
- Drift Log
- Detection Card

**How EIOC Satisfies This:**  
EIOC provides structured detection of emotional-layer anomalies that arise specifically in human-AI interactions.

---

### 3.3 MEASURE Function

#### MEASURE 1.1 – Trustworthiness Assessment

**NIST Requirement:**  
Organizations must assess whether AI systems support human agency and understanding.

**EIOC Contribution:**
- Cognitive Fog detection
- Emotional Drift tracking
- Verification Protocol Sheet
- Drift Log (longitudinal evidence)

**How EIOC Satisfies This:**  
EIOC provides measurable indicators of when AI output overwhelms, confuses, or destabilizes human operators.

---

#### MEASURE 2.1 – Monitoring for Anomalies

**NIST Requirement:**  
Organizations must monitor for anomalous or harmful system behavior.

**EIOC Contribution:**
- Tier Classification
- Correlated Compromise logic
- Incident Triage Form

**How EIOC Satisfies This:**  
EIOC treats multi-indicator emotional events as systemic anomalies, enabling structured monitoring.

---

### 3.4 MANAGE Function

#### MANAGE 1.1 – Risk Mitigation Controls

**NIST Requirement:**  
Organizations must implement controls to mitigate identified risks.

**EIOC Contribution:**
- Circuit Breaker Cues
- Verification Rituals
- Escalation Ladder

**How EIOC Satisfies This:**  
EIOC provides actionable, repeatable controls that interrupt emotional-layer compromise.

---

#### MANAGE 2.1 – Incident Response & Recovery

**NIST Requirement:**  
Organizations must respond to and recover from AI-related incidents.

**EIOC Contribution:**
- Incident Triage Form
- Drift Log
- Post-Incident Hardening
- Operator Removal Protocol (Tier 4–5)

**How EIOC Satisfies This:**  
EIOC defines a complete emotional-layer incident response cycle, from detection to recovery.

---

## 4. Summary of Alignment

| NIST Function | EIOC Component | Alignment Summary |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **GOVERN** | Operator Posture, Tier Model | Defines human roles & culture |
| **MAP** | Primitives, Pattern Library | Identifies emotional-layer risks |
| **MEASURE** | Drift Log, Triage Form | Provides measurable indicators |
| **MANAGE** | Verification, Escalation | Provides actionable controls |

**EIOC fills the human-layer operational gap in the NIST AI RMF.**

---

## 5. Conformance Statement

An organization may claim **EIOC–NIST AI RMF Alignment** if:

1. EIOC primitives are used to detect emotional-layer risks.
2. Tier escalation is applied to multi-indicator events.
3. Verification protocols are used for Tier 2+ events.
4. Drift Logs and Triage Forms are maintained as evidence.
5. EIOC controls are mapped to NIST AI RMF subcategories.
