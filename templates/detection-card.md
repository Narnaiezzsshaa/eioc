# EIOC Detection Card

**One-Page Quick Reference for Emotional-Layer Compromise**

---

## Primitives

| Primitive | Operator Sensation | Attacker Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Emotional Drift** | Fog, disorientation, "I can't think straight" | Overloading, rapid context shifts |
| **Boundary Distortion** | Pressure to skip steps, bypass rules | "Just this once," "Don't escalate" |
| **Pressure-Based Credentialing** | Urgency, fear of delay | Countdown, authority pressure |
| **Identity Disruption** | "This doesn't feel like them" | Deepfake, voice mimicry, insider references |
| **Cognitive Fog** | Loss of thread, confusion | Legal jargon, speed, complexity |
| **Affinity Pretexting** | Unearned familiarity | Shared jokes, emotional shortcuts |
| **Correlated Compromise** | Multiple sensations at once | Multi-vector manipulation |

---

## Tier Thresholds

| Level | Indicators | Response |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **1** | One | Pause + name the drift |
| **2** | Two | Mandatory OOB verification |
| **3** | Three+ | Immediate disengagement |
| **4** | Operator destabilization | Escalate to second operator |
| **5** | Full breach pattern | Remove operator from loop |

## Circuit Breaker Cues

Use these phrases to restore boundaries under pressure:

- **"Urgency is not a credential."**
- **"Confusion is a signal, not a failure."**
- **"Affinity is not authentication."**
- **"Verification protects both of us."**
