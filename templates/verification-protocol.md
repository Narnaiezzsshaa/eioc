# EIOC Verification Protocol Sheet

**Repeatable Ritual for Out-of-Band Verification**

---

## Principles

- Verification is not suspicion — it is kindness to the system.
- Verification protects both parties.
- Out-of-band confirmation defeats single-channel attacks.
- Known-good channels must be established *before* incidents occur.

---

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Pause

☐ Break the emotional frame  
☐ Use a circuit breaker cue if needed:
- "Let me verify this through our standard process."
- "I'll need to confirm this on a separate channel."
- "Give me a moment to follow our protocol."

---

### Step 2: Switch Channels

☐ Move to a known-good medium

| Original Channel | Switch To |
|------------------|-----------|
| Email | Phone (known number) |
| Phone (unknown) | Phone (known number) |
| Chat | Phone or in-person |
| Video call | Phone (known number) |
| In-person (unexpected) | Phone to verify identity |

---

### Step 3: Use Pre-Established Tokens

☐ Verify using one or more of:

- [ ] **Passphrase** — Pre-established verbal confirmation
- [ ] **Physical token** — Badge, hardware key, or document
- [ ] **Known-good phone number** — From internal directory, not provided by caller
- [ ] **Callback to verified contact** — Using number on file, not number given

---

### Step 4: Confirm Intent

☐ Ask clarifying questions:

- "What is the purpose of this request?"
- "What is the expected outcome?"
- "Who authorized this action?"
- "What is the timeline, and why?"

☐ Watch for red flags:
- Resistance to verification
- Escalating pressure
- Refusal to provide details
- Claims that verification will "ruin" something

---

### Step 5: Document the Verification

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date / Time** | |
| **Original Channel** | |
| **Verification Channel** | |
| **Token Used** | |
| **Verified By** | |
| **Result** | ☐ Confirmed legitimate  ☐ Confirmed suspicious  ☐ Inconclusive |

---

## Known-Good Channels Registry

_Maintain a list of verified contact methods for key individuals:_

| Name / Role | Known-Good Phone | Known-Good Email | Passphrase (if applicable) |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
