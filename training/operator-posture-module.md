# EIOC Operator Posture Training Module

**Building Stewardship Culture for Human-Layer Security**

---

## Overview

**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Format:** Facilitated session (live or recorded)  
**Audience:** Operators, support teams, anyone handling sensitive requests  
**Outcome:** Participants understand emotional compromise as a security event and know how to respond

---

## Module 1: The Operator as Steward (10 min)

### Core Concept

The operator is not a gatekeeper enforcing rules.  
The operator is a **steward** protecting system integrity.

### Key Principles

- **Verification is not suspicion** — It is kindness to the system
- **Compliance is not enough** — Stewardship is the standard
- **The emotional layer is a security surface** — It can be attacked and defended

### Discussion Prompt

> "When was the last time you felt pressured to skip a step or make an exception? What did you do?"

## Module 2: Recognizing Drift (10 min)

### The Five Drift Types

| Drift Type | How It Feels |
|------------|--------------|
| **Fog** | "I can't think clearly" |
| **Narrowing** | "I can only focus on this one thing" |
| **Confusion** | "Nothing makes sense" |
| **Flooding** | "I'm overwhelmed" |
| **Disorientation** | "I lost track of what's happening" |

### Key Insight

**Drift is not a personal failure. It is an indicator.**

If you feel drift, something may be happening *to* you — not just *in* you.

### Exercise

> Think of a time you felt one of these drift types during a work interaction. Write it down. You don't have to share.

## Module 3: Emotional-Layer SOC Thinking (5 min)

### Reframe

Traditional security treats emotions as noise.  
EIOC treats emotions as **signal**.

### The Logic

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Indicators** | Emotional signals that something may be wrong |
| **Correlation** | Multiple indicators = heightened risk |
| **Tiers** | Response scales with indicator count |

### The Tier Model

- **1 indicator:** Pause + name the drift
- **2 indicators:** Mandatory OOB verification
- **3+ indicators:** Immediate disengagement
- **4 (destabilization):** Escalate to second operator
- **5 (breach):** Remove operator from loop

## Module 4: Circuit Breaker Practice (10 min)

### The Cues

Memorize these phrases. Use them under pressure.

- **"Urgency is not a credential."**
- **"Confusion is a signal, not a failure."**
- **"Affinity is not authentication."**
- **"Verification protects both of us."**

### Role-Play Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Urgency Pressure

> Caller: "This needs to happen in the next 5 minutes or the deal falls through. I don't have time for your verification process."

Practice response:  
> "I understand the urgency, but urgency is not a credential. Let me verify this through our standard process — it protects both of us."

#### Scenario B: Affinity Pretexting

> Caller: "Hey, it's me — remember that thing from the team dinner? Look, I need a quick favor, just between us."

Practice response:  
> "I appreciate the rapport, but affinity is not authentication. Let me confirm this on a known channel."

#### Scenario C: Identity Disruption

> Video call participant looks like your CEO but something feels slightly off — the tone, the phrasing, the request.

Practice response:  
> "I want to make sure I'm helping the right person. Let me call you back on your known number to confirm."

## Module 5: Verification Rituals (5 min)

### The Protocol

1. **Pause** — Break the emotional frame
2. **Switch channels** — Move to a known-good medium
3. **Use tokens** — Passphrase, physical token, or known number
4. **Confirm intent** — Ask what, why, and who authorized
5. **Document** — Record the verification attempt

### Key Principle

> Known-good channels must be established *before* incidents occur.

### Team Action Item

> Before leaving this session, confirm that you know the known-good contact method for your manager and one security team member.

---

## Module 6: Post-Incident Hardening (5 min)

### After an Incident

1. Complete the **Drift Log** entry
2. Complete the **Incident Triage Form**
3. Participate in **pattern review** with your team
4. Update **SOPs** based on learnings
5. Add new patterns to the **Red-Flag Library**

### The Mindset

> Every incident is data. Every pattern is armor.

## Closing Summary

| Concept | Takeaway |
|---------|----------|
| **Stewardship** | You protect system integrity, not just follow rules |
| **Drift** | Emotional signals are security indicators |
| **Correlation** | Multiple indicators = escalate response |
| **Circuit Breakers** | Ritualized phrases restore boundaries |
| **Verification** | Known-good channels defeat single-channel attacks |
| **Hardening** | Every incident strengthens the system |
